## Running the Project via Terminal
  - You need to have Node.js installed on your system. If it's not installed, you can download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). I was using Node.js v22.5.1 for this project.
  - npm(Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js, so you should have it installed already.
  - In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and run "npm install".
  - After installing the dependencies, start the development server by typing "npm run dev".
  - Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to view the app. While creating the project I was mainly using Google Chrome as a browser.
  - To stop the development server, press Ctrl + C in your terminal.
